# Codidact Feature Development Repository

This is the location where all formal work will be stored that will document the process of work from conceptualization through to a visual and written specification that the development team will use to implement the application.

### This repository will contain the results of:
* ***Use cases*** developed from our original [functional specification](https://github.com/codidact/docs/wiki/Functional-Specification)
* ***Wireframes***, fleshed out from the predefined use cases. Wireframes will encourage more focused discussion around features and processes that users will interact with. The back end development team will use the wireframes to ensure the back end and front end requirements are in sync
* ***High fidelity designs*** pixel perfect representations of the final features and processes of the app. The front end development team will use these to bring the app to life

This is in essence, the design process of Codidact, as a result this is incredibly important work so great effort has been made to provide a structured, sound approach and methodology to ensure we can both act with agency and also allow the community already growing around us to contribute - even if they aren't 'designers'.

**Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/codidact/feature-development/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a firm idea of what this process is.** Yes, it's a bit wordy, but it outlines how this crucial aspect of product development will be successful, and we are doing our best to make sure you can be a part of it.
