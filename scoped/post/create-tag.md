**Basic flow**

- For a user with TL3, there is a "create tag" control next to the tag area of the edit interface.

- User selects the control.

- An in-page dialogue prompts for the tag name (required) and short description (optional but encouraged).  This dialogue includes something like "new tag in (category name)", to gently remind the person what part of the site we're in.

- User types a tag name.  Similar tag names are shown.  The user might dismiss the dialogue at this point and choose to use an existing tag instead.

- User clicks into the description textbox and contextual help appears with basic guidance (a sentence or so).

- User types a description and then chooses "create tag" button.

- Tag is created and added to the question being edited.

**Notes**

Tag creation is an explicit act; you can't create a tag just by typing its name while editing tags in a question.  This should cut down on typo-tags.

We prompt for a short description at tag-creation time to reduce the chances of having "what the heck is this tag for?" queries from other users.  However, we'll make entering it optional, so people who can't write a decent description don't just mash the keyboard to get past the dialogue.
