**Termination outcome**
User is on question/post page for the now-posted item.

----

**Basic flow**

- User clicks on "ask question" / "post" / etc button (name can vary by category).

- New page has:
  - for first-time poster, intro message w/link to help (just-in-time help; can be simple or omitted for MVP)
  - "New post in (category name)" - header to reinforce where you are
  - places to enter title, body, tags

- User fills out form.  (For MVP we aren't doing any dupe-detection, auto-review, special guidance.)

- User clicks "post" button.

- Page refreshes to show page for the individual post (e.g. question page).

----

**Notes**

Omitted for now: preview, contextual guidance, switching categories.  Try not to do anything that precludes adding these features later.
