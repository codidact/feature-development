**Name**  
Delete post (TL5)

----

**Actor**  
Signed-in user with TL5 (elected moderator)

----

**Subject area**  
Any post (see preconditions)

----

**Preconditions**  
None.  Moderators can delete anything.


----

**Termination outcome**  
Post is deleted (see details below).


----

**Basic flow**  

User sees a post and (if there are flags) an indicator of outstanding flags.  Outstanding flags work as for the lock case.

User decides post should be deleted.  User chooses "moderate" control and, from there, chooses "delete".

User chooses "apply" (or whatever we call it) to complete the deletion.  Outcome is the same as for delete-post-tl4.md.


----

**Notes**  

We haven't specified community deletions yet, so I put the control on the "moderate" menu.  If we do community delete votes later we should move this control for consistency.

Should outstanding spam or rude flags be auto-resolved?
