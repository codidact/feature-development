**Basic flow**

- User chooses "can't answer" control.  (That is not a literal text string; we need to think how to convey this.)
- User is presented with choices and guidance for how to use them:
  - Needs your attention + textbox (required)
  - Off topic + textbox (optional)
- User chooses an option, optionally writes a comment, and submits.
- Page updates:
  - For the user: "can't answer" control changes to indicate you've already done this.
  - For the OP: a message is added (above? below?) the question with a carefully-written, friendly message (TBD) about the issue, along with the user-submitted comment and an "edit now" link/button/prompt.  (Need to do something here for the off-topic case.)
  - For the public: comment is added: "The community has requested more information" + comment or "This question might not be on-topic here" + comment.  (Need to massage that text, but that general idea.)

**Notes**

Yes, "duplicate" is intentionally not part of a "close" flow.  See duplicate.md.
