**Name**  
Propose edit

----

**Actor**  
User with a trust level that does not support direct editing.

----

**Subject area**  
Any post page (e.g. question page).

----

**Preconditions**  
None

----

**Termination outcome**  
Edit is submitted successfully; page is refreshed with original content and a "your edit suggestion has been submitted" message.  Message contains a link to the edit (like what reviewers would see).

----

**Basic flow**

- User clicks on the "edit" link for a post.
- Edit page opens, with a prominent notice saying roughly: "Your suggested edit will be reviewed after you submit it and will not appear immediately.  Please make all changes in a single edit; you will not be able to submit another edit while this one is still pending."
- User edits title, body, and/or tags (interface is the same as for creating the post in the first place).
- User writes an edit reason in the textbox for that purpose.  (There should be some text explaining briefly what makes a good edit message.)
- User chooses "submit edit" control.
- Page refreshes as described in "outcome" above.

----

**Note**

The refresh after the edit shows the original text and provides a way to get to the edit.  The alternative would be to show the edited version with a notice that this is only visible to you (like SE does).  My gut feeling is that the page should reflect the post's actual state, especially since you can't pile up more edits, but I'm certainly open to discussion.
