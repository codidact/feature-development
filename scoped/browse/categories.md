**Basic flow**

User sees indicators of two or more categories (for example, Q&A, Meta, Blog).  For purposes of this use case I'll assume tabs, but I do not intend to constrain the design.

User hovers over the tab for "Q&A" and sees a short description of the category.

User repeats the previous step for another category and sees its short description. User might iterate.

User selects a category.

User is taken to the posts list for that category.  At the top of the page is the category's long description (what is this category for), which might contain help links.

User reads description and begins exploring questions (see question-list.md).

On this or a future visit, user is tired of seeing the long description and dismisses it.
