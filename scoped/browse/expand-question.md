**Basic flow**

User is on a question list per question-list.md.  (This use case does not apply to categories that do not have questions, like wikis.)

User scrolls or pages through list reading info until spotting a question of interest.

Upon spotting an interesting question, user selects the "expand" control to learn more without navigating away.

Page updates to show a summary of the question below the title/tags in the question list.  Summary includes: 

- opening of question body (something like 300-500 characters?) 
- for each answer: up/down votes, author, last-modified date, opening line or so
- if there are more than N answers (threshold TBD), show only the first N and then something like "4 more"
